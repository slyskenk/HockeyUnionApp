# Player	player/	Read news, view events, forum, profile, team info

# Coach	coach/	Edit news/events, manage team, tactical chatbot

# Admin	admin/	Full CRUD, role mgmt, forum mod, notifications

# Supporter	supporter/	View-only news/events, highlights, polls, merch

# Shared responsibilities like Forum and Chatbot should still live within each role folder for clarity (e.g., Forum.tsx in both /player, /coach).
